# Palindrome Checker Web Application

Build a Palindrome Checker web application that helps users determine if a given text is a palindrome. Palindromes are words or phrases that read the same forwards and backward, disregarding punctuation, case, and spacing.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating an interactive web app where users can input text, and the application checks whether it is a palindrome or not. The key features include:

- Input element with the ID `text-input`.
- Button element with the ID `check-btn`.
- Result display in a div element with the ID `result`.

## Features

- Check if a given text is a palindrome.
- Handle variations in punctuation, case, and spacing.
- Provide user-friendly feedback based on the palindrome check.

## User Stories

1. Users should be able to input text in the designated input field.
2. Clicking the check button without entering text should prompt a user alert.
3. The app should accurately identify palindromes and provide appropriate results.
4. Enhance the user interface to display dynamic feedback.
