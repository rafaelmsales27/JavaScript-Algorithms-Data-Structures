# Basic MP3 Player Web Application

Let's delve into essential string and array methods by building a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aims to strengthen your understanding of crucial concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, and implementing features like play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. You'll also learn how to dynamically update your user interface based on the current song.

## Project Overview

This hands-on project will guide you through the implementation of a basic MP3 player, covering essential JavaScript methods, including:

- `find()`: Locating specific elements in an array.
- `forEach()`: Iterating through array elements.
- `map()`: Creating a new array by applying a function to each element.
- `join()`: Joining array elements into a string.
