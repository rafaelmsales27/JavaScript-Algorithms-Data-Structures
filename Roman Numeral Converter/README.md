# Roman Numeral Converter Project

In this Roman Numeral Converter project, I explored fundamental JavaScript programming concepts to build a web application that converts Arabic numerals to Roman numerals. This hands-on project provided valuable insights into key programming techniques.

## Project Overview

The project involved creating a user-friendly Roman Numeral Converter web application, incorporating the following programming concepts:

- **Event Handling:** Utilized the `addEventListener` method to capture button clicks for initiating the conversion process.
- **Conditional Statements:** Implemented conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, and `else`) for validating user input and displaying appropriate messages.
- **Array and Object Usage:** Employed arrays and objects to store numeral symbols and their corresponding values, facilitating the conversion logic.
- **Function Implementation:** Created a reusable function, `convertToRoman`, to handle the conversion process based on the input.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **User Input Validation:** Implemented robust validation to ensure that the entered number falls within the valid range for conversion.
- **Conversion Logic:** Developed a comprehensive conversion logic that transforms Arabic numerals into Roman numerals based on predefined rules.
- **UI Interaction:** Applied the Document Object Model (DOM) to interact with HTML elements, dynamically updating the user interface.
- **Reusability:** Designed a modular and reusable function for converting numbers to Roman numerals, promoting code maintainability.

## Reflection

This project deepened my understanding of JavaScript by allowing me to apply essential programming concepts in a practical context. The experience gained from building the Roman Numeral Converter contributes to my proficiency in web development.
