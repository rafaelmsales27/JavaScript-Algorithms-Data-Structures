# Number Sorter Project

Took on the challenge of mastering fundamental sorting algorithms in computer science by building a number sorter project. This hands-on experience guided me through the implementation and visualization of different sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort, using JavaScript. The project aimed to deepen my understanding of the fundamental concepts behind these algorithms and how to apply them effectively to sort numerical data in web applications.

## Project Overview

During this project, I focused on implementing and visualizing key sorting algorithms, including:

- **Bubble Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort:** An in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region, and repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region.
- **Insertion Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Algorithmic Understanding:** Gain a deep understanding of fundamental sorting algorithms used in computer science.
- **JavaScript Implementation:** Learn how to implement sorting algorithms using JavaScript for effective data manipulation.
- **Visualization Techniques:** Explore visualization techniques to understand the step-by-step process of each sorting algorithm.
- **Application in Web Development:** Understand how sorting algorithms ar
