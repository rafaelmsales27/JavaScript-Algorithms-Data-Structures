# Decimal to Binary Converter with Recursion

Learn recursion by building a Decimal to Binary Converter. Recursion, a powerful programming concept, involves a function calling itself, breaking down complex problems into simpler sub-problems until they become straightforward to solve. In this project, you'll explore the fundamental concepts of recursion, delve into the call stack, and build a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation.

## Project Overview

Recursion provides an elegant solution to problem-solving by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. In this project, you'll build a Decimal to Binary Converter using JavaScript. Key aspects of the project include:

- Understanding the fundamental concepts of recursion.
- Exploring the call stack and its role in recursion.
- Building a visual representation of the recursion process with animation.

## Features
