# LocalStorage Todo App

Learn LocalStorage by building a Todo App. This project introduces you to the concept of LocalStorage, a web browser feature that allows web applications to store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. Throughout this TODO application, you'll gain practical experience handling form inputs, managing local storage, and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. Additionally, you'll explore event listeners and toggling UI elements.

## Project Overview

LocalStorage is a powerful tool for web developers, enabling web applications to save data during one session and retrieve it in a later page session. In this project, you'll apply LocalStorage to build a Todo App with the following features:

- Handle form inputs for task creation.
- Manage local storage for persistent data storage.
- Perform CRUD operations on tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Implement event listeners for user interaction.
- Toggle UI elements dynamically.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of LocalStorage.
- Learn how to handle form inputs effectively.
- Implement CRUD operations to manipulate task data.
- Utilize event listeners for a responsive user interface.
- Explore toggling techniques for dynamic UI updates.
