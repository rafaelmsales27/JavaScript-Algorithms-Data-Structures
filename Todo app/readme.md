# LocalStorage Todo App

Took the initiative to learn LocalStorage by building a Todo App. This project introduced me to the concept of LocalStorage, a web browser feature that allows web applications to store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. Throughout this hands-on experience, I gained practical skills in handling form inputs, managing local storage, and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. I also explored event listeners and toggling UI elements for a seamless user experience.

## Project Overview

LocalStorage is a powerful tool for web developers, enabling web applications to save data during one session and retrieve it in a later page session. In this project, you'll apply LocalStorage to build a Todo App with the following features:

- Handle form inputs for task creation.
- Manage local storage for persistent data storage.
- Perform CRUD operations on tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Implement event listeners for user interaction.
- Toggle UI elements dynamically.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of LocalStorage.
- Learn how to handle form inputs effectively.
- Implement CRUD operations to manipulate task data.
- Utilize event listeners for a responsive user interface.
- Explore toggling techniques for dynamic UI updates.
